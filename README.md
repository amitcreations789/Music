# How to make a music player using java -

- Create or convert a music file to .wav file (because java doesn't support any other type of music files. 
- After converting that just copy that file and paste it on your package file. 
-  If you are using Eclipse ID then it would be more easy.
-  After pasting that music file into your package file, just go to my repository and copy my code and paste it.
-  Then just change the music file where I have given - At line no. 10  'File file = new File("REal.wav"); ', Here you can see here that my file name is REal.wav so change it according to your music file.
-  Then Just run the code and enjoy, Have fun !

This is how it looks like -
